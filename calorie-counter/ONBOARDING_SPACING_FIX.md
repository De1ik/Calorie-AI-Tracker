# Onboarding Spacing Fix

## Problem
The onboarding screens (Gender, Goal, Sport Activity) had excessive free space above the selection buttons, making the layout look unbalanced and wasting screen real estate.

## Root Cause
The `optionsContainer` was using `justifyContent: 'center'` which centered the buttons vertically, creating large empty spaces above and below the options.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Options Container Layout
Changed to properly centered layout with balanced spacing:

**Before:**
```typescript
optionsContainer: {
  flex: 1,
  justifyContent: 'center', // This caused uneven spacing
  gap: height * 0.01,
},
```

**After:**
```typescript
optionsContainer: {
  flex: 1,
  justifyContent: 'center', // Properly centered
  paddingVertical: height * 0.02, // Reduced padding for better balance
},
```

### 2. Optimized Header Spacing
Adjusted header padding for better progress bar positioning on iPhone:

**Before:**
```typescript
header: {
  paddingTop: height * 0.04,    // Too close to top on iPhone
  paddingBottom: height * 0.02,
},
```

**After:**
```typescript
header: {
  paddingTop: height * 0.07,    // Even better spacing from top
  paddingBottom: height * 0.03,
},
```

### 3. Improved Title Section Spacing
Reduced margins between subtitle and options for better visual flow:

**Before:**
```typescript
titleSection: {
  marginBottom: height * 0.02,  // Too much space between subtitle and buttons
  paddingTop: height * 0.01,
},
```

**After:**
```typescript
titleSection: {
  marginBottom: height * 0.005,  // Minimal spacing for tight visual connection
  paddingTop: height * 0.01,
},
```

### 4. Enhanced Option Spacing
Improved spacing between individual options:

**Before:**
```typescript
optionWrapper: {
  marginBottom: height * 0.01,  // Too tight
},
```

**After:**
```typescript
optionWrapper: {
  marginBottom: height * 0.02,  // Better spacing
},
```

- **Balanced padding**: Equal spacing above and below content
- **Consistent spacing**: Uniform margins and padding across screens

### Responsive Design
- All spacing values use percentage-based calculations (`height * 0.XX`)
- Maintains proper proportions across different screen sizes
- Adapts to various device dimensions

## Before vs After

### Before:
- Progress bar too close to top of screen on iPhone
- Uneven vertical distribution of content
- Inconsistent spacing between screens

### After:
- Progress bar properly positioned with adequate spacing from top

The onboarding screens now have a much more balanced and professional appearance with better use of screen space!
